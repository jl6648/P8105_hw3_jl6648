# probelm 2 
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)                                                                  # load the data
data("brfss_smart2010") 
```

```{r}
brfss_df =
  brfss_smart2010 |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") |>
  separate(locationdesc, into = c("state", "county"), sep = " - ") |>
  filter(response == "Excellent" | response == "Very good" | response == "Good" | 
         response == "Fair" | response == "Poor") |>
  mutate(response = as.factor(response),
         response = ordered(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) 
```

## question 1
In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about in 2010?
```{r}
prob1_q1_02 = filter(brfss_df, year == 2002) |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarize(n_obs = n_distinct(county)) |>
  filter(n_obs >= 7) 

state_2002 = pull(prob1_q1_02, state)
```
In 2002, following states `r state_2002` were observed at 7 or more location

```{r}
prob1_q1_10 = filter(brfss_df, year == 2010) |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarize(n_obs = n_distinct(county)) |>
  filter(n_obs >= 7) 

state_2010 = pull(prob1_q1_10, state)
```
In 2002, following states `r state_2010` were observed at 7 or more location

### question 2
